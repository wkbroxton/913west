# NINE13West Consulting

I wasn't aware at the time, but this idea was seeded 13 weeks ago when I made a career shift to pursue Software Engineering in a cohort of strangers. There's something about a collective experience that brings people together. You know the story: Boy meets cohort | Boy and cohort becomes friends | Boy creates an opportunity for the cohort to continue outside the immersive. 

Nine13West Consulting is a group of passionate & talented junior software engineers looking to sharpen their skills on real-life applications and user stories. Formed out of a 12-week Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly, this team knows how to work together, produce quality applications while having some fun along the way. 

Allow NINE13WEST to service your software developing needs.
