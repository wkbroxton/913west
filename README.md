# NINE13West Consulting

I wasn't aware at the time, but this idea was seeded 13 weeks ago when I made a career shift to persue Software Engineering in a cohort of strangers. There's something about a collective experience that brings people together. You know the story: Boy meets cohort | Boy and cohort becomes friends | Boy creates an opportunity for cohort to continue outside of the immersive. Nine13West Counsulting is a group of passionate & talented junior software engineers looking to sharpen their skills on real life applications and user stories. There's something about a collective experience that brings people together. This Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly gave to a new career for me, and a brand new set of eclectic, lifelong friends.
